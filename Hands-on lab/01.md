## Exercise 1: Implementing Just-in-Time (JIT) access

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will secure a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) workstation using the Azure Security Center Just-in-Time Access feature.

### Task 1: Setup virtual machine with JIT

1. In a browser, navigate to your Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

2. Select **Security Center,** then under **Cloud Security** select **Azure defender** and then select Just-In-time-Vm access.

    > **Note**: Your subscription may not be set up with the **Standard** tier; if that is the case then do the following:

   - In the **Security Center** blade, select **Pricing & settings**.
   - Select your subscription.
   - Select **Pricing Tier**.
   - Select **Standard**.
   - Select **Save**.
   - Navigate back to Security Center, select **Just in time VM access**.

3. Select the **Configured** tab, and verify the lab VMs (db-1, paw-1 and web-1) are displayed.  If not, select the **Not Configured** tab, and then check the checkbox to select the lab VMs (db-1, paw-1 and web-1), and then select the **Enable JIT on 3 VMs** link.

    ![In the Virtual machines list, the Recommended tab is selected and the db-1, paw-1 and web-1 virtual machines are selected for Just-in-time access.](media/2.png "Virtual Machines Selected")

    > **Note**: It could take up to 10 minutes for new VMs to show up if you upgraded to standard tier security.  Also note that it is possible new VMs display in the **No recommendation** tab until a backend process moves them to the **Recommended** tab.  In you find the VMs do not show up after 10 minutes, you can manually enable JIT by choosing the **Configuration** tab in the VMs configuration blade and then **Enable JIT Access**.

    ![Configuration and Enable JIT Access is highlighted in the Azure portal.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image119.png "Enable JIT")

4. In the configuration window that opens, review the settings, then select **Save**.

    ![In the configuration window, port settings are listed, and Save is highlighted above them.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image10.png "Select Save")

5. After a few minutes, you should see the virtual machines moved to the **Configured** tab.

    ![The virtual machines are now on the configured tab.](images/2.png "The JIT Configured VMs are displayed")

### Task 2: Perform a JIT request

1. Select the **paw-1** virtual machine, and then select **Request access**.

    ![On the Virtual machines screen, the first listed virtual machine name is selected and highlighted (paw-1), as is Request access button above it.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image12.png "Request access for paw-1")

2. For each of the ports, select the **On** toggle button, notice how the default IP settings is **My IP**.

    ![On is selected under the Toggle column for all four of the ports listed under paw-1.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image13.png "Select on for each of the ports")

3. At the bottom of the dialog, select **Open ports**. After a few moments, you should now see the **APPROVED** requests have been incremented and the **Last Access** is set to **Active now.**.

    ![On the Virtual machines screen, the paw-1 virtual machine displays 1 Request as approved, and the last access column shows Active now.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image14.png "View Approved and Last Access status")

    > **Note**  If you did not wait for your VMs and virtual networks to be fully provisioned via the ARM template, you may get an error.

4. Select the ellipses, then select **Activity Log**, you will be able to see a history of who requests access to the virtual machines.

    ![Activity Log is highlighted in the shortcut menu for the last user.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image15.png "View the Activity Log")

    > **Note**: These entries will persist after you have deleted the VMs. You will need to manually remove them after VM deletion.

5. In the Azure Portal main menu, select **All Services**, then type **Network**, then select **Network security groups**.

    ![All services is highlighted in the left menu of the Azure portal, and the Network security groups is highlighted in the filtered list to the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image16.png "Select paw-1-nsg")

6. In the filter textbox, type **paw-1-nsg**, then select the **paw-1-nsg** network security group.

7. Select **Inbound security rules.** You should now see inbound security rules set up by JIT Access.
